3	About 10% of Iceland is covered by glaciers that contain the equivalent of twenty years of rainfall for the entire country.
4	The main characteristic of glaciers is that they move.
5	As a glacier glides forward at a rapid pace, its surface cracks.
6	This happens because the top layers of ice (about 20-30 meters deep) are brittle, resulting in many deep cavities and fissures.
7	At lower depths the ice is more solid.
8	Changes in the atmosphere affect the glaciers expansion and movement.
9	Iceland has many sub glacial volcanoes.
10	The melting ice from an eruption can cause devastating floods.
11	Approximately one third of Icelands excess water, which is returned to the sea, is glacial water.
12	The glaciers are generally accessible barring restrictions due to current conditions.
13	Langjökull is the countries second largest glacier.
