1	Vilborg Arnarsdóttir (Bogga in Súðavík) created this garden.
2	She has had a long standing dream of creating a playground for children, families and guests visiting the Westfjords in the summer.
3	Her intention was to encourage quality time for children to share with their parents by enabling out door activities and excercise in a dedicated area.
4	She started serious work on the project after she lost her son, Ragnar Freyr Vestfjörð, who died in a car crash in Súðavík in 2001, only 17 years old.
