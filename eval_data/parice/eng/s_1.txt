0	If they don't like it they'll go to Ísafjörður.
1	That better not happen...
2	No... that better not happen!
3	-The guys from there are assholes.
4	Maybe not assholes,
5	but they can be a bit difficult when they come here to play.
6	-Difficult?
7	They're all maggots.
8	Þrándur certainly succeeded in spreading his evil among them.
9	Þrándur?
10	-An asshole.
11	President of their golf club.
12	-Or the spawn of the devil according to the phone book.
13	Enough of that.
14	In a fortnight the course will be tip–top.
15	Is that clear?
16	Since when do you follow soccer?
17	How am I supposed to get back to Ísafjörður?
18	It's the first day, I don't even know them.
19	Yeah...
20	I can ask him.
21	Yes.
22	Bye.
23	Finni?
24	-Yes.
25	Can you drive me home?
26	-No, I've got to work at the pool.
27	Isn't Rakel picking you up?
28	-She's watching a soccer match.
29	Do you work at the pool too?
30	-Not like that, work on my tan.
31	Is Rakel checking out the new Spanish goalkeeper?
32	I don't know.
33	Can you help me out?
34	Sorry, the sun fades so fast in the afternoon.
35	You just have to hitchhike.
36	...risky betting on age.
37	-I just don't agree.
38	What is Rakel doing here?
39	She probably want's a Tommi Dog for lunch.
40	Have fun!
41	Hi, how are you?
42	-Fine.
43	What are you doing here?
44	-Wanna join me for lunch?
45	Sure, we just finished.
46	Tommi.
47	-Yes.
48	I've been thinking about our relationship.
49	Yes.
50	-And...
51	I'm think we should take a break.
52	What?
53	A break?
54	I thought we were all good?
55	Yes, but situations have changed.
56	Changed?
57	Didn't you just drag me to the Westfjords?
58	Yes...
59	I still care deeply for you and we're quite compatible.
60	But...
61	I've fallen out of love with you.
62	Are you kidding me?
63	So...
64	Are we gonna live together, but not be together?
65	No.
66	Linda og Halli have a room here in Bolungarvík, if you want.
67	Linda and Halli?
68	Are you kicking me out right now?
69	I'm not gonna live at your aunt's!
70	You could ask Finni or Kiddi.
71	I barely know them.
72	Kiddi is a total weirdo and Finni... he definitely has brain damage.
73	He's a bit different but he's jolly.
74	So what do I do with all my stuff?
75	It's all in the trunk, you can take it now if you want.
76	Once the sheep brawn is on, we bring the magic.
77	Courtesy of uncle Bjarni.
78	What's his problem?
79	What about just as a camp counselor?
80	No openings?
81	Can you call if anything opens up?
82	Just e-mail?
83	Yes...
84	OK.
85	Bye.
86	Is the rake wreaking havoc?
87	Piss off!
88	I am so fed up with your lazy ass!
89	You never do anything accept dump all the work on me!
90	Kiddi...
91	Sorry about earlier.
92	I just lost it.
93	Please...
94	Don't worry about it.
95	So...
96	Do you wanna talk about it?
97	Yeah...
98	Rakel just broke up with me.
99	Said she wants to take a break, but I know what that means.
100	Slut.
101	You want some?
102	No, I quit.
103	And what?
104	Did she say why?
105	No, just that she wasn't sure.
106	Not sure?
107	Didn't she drag you over here?
108	Yeah, exactly.
109	What's wrong with her?
110	What are you going to do?
111	Go back to Reykjavík?
112	I can't...
113	I just spoke to the job center, there is nothing available.
114	Not even as a camp counselor.
115	What are you going to do?
116	Just stay here?
117	I have to.
118	I just can't believe I'm stuck at Bolungarvík.
119	"In Bolungarvík"!
120	You wouldn't say "At Reykjavík".
121	Where are you gonna stay?
122	-I have no idea.
123	Rakel said her aunt had a spare room... there is no way I'm staying there.
124	Not in a million years.
125	Could I maybe crash at your place?
126	Just until I get a job back south.
127	Good morning.
128	-Good morning.
129	Dude, didn't you shower?
130	-No, Tómas...
131	I don't shower naked with other nude men.
132	Man, this is gonna be sweet.
133	Everything will be fine.
134	-I guess so.
135	And don't listen to mom if she's nagging.
136	If you wanna fry eggs and bacon after a night out... go right ahead.
137	-OK.
138	Thanks for saving my ass.
139	-Sure thing.
140	Forget about Rakel.
141	She's used to breaking the hearts of good men.
142	You're not the first.
143	-Yeah?
144	She's like the mink, just hunts for fun.
145	Vicious creature.
146	Okay...
147	She was always nice to me.
148	The mink is also cute, but you don't want it in a chicken coop.
149	What are you babbling about?
150	It doesn't make any sense.
151	You'll get it one day.
152	Now it's time to wipe your ass, get a tan and get drunk tonight.
153	I guess so.
154	-You know it.
155	I would also buy a new car.
156	That heals all wounds.
157	-Yeah?
158	I might sell mine.
159	-Should I buy it?
160	No, you don't want a Japanese sardine can.
161	You want American muscle.
