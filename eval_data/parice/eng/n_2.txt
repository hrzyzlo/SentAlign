0	In 1950, 2.5 billion people lived on our planet.
1	By 2050, the global population will be around 10 billion – a four-fold increase in a century.
2	The United Nations has long said that this is only feasible if we plan for it.
3	It was for this purpose that the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), often called the Brundtland Commission, was set up in 1983.
4	Its final report, Our Common Future, highlighted the links between the environment, the economy and social development.
5	We have to meet our current needs without weakening the basis for future generations to meet theirs.
6	In 2015, some 32 years later,
7	the UN General Assembly agreed 17 Sustainable Development Goals,
8	and the Paris Agreement was adopted later that year.
9	We will strive to limit the average global rise in temperature to a maximum of 1.5°, all countries must adjust their targets every five years, and a robust reporting system will be set up.
10	All of this is important if we are to meet our long-term goal of achieving climate neutrality in the second half of this century.
11	The necessary knowledge and structures are already in place.
12	The Nordic Region now has an opportunity to show that it is willing to take the lead in the transition that we must undergo to ensure tolerable living conditions for the 10 billion people on Earth in 2050.
13	On behalf of the Nordic Council of Ministers, I travelled around the Nordic Region along with senior adviser Satu Reijonen.
14	We walked 170 kilometres, cycled 70 kilometres and attended 119 meetings.
15	We met researchers, business leaders, politicians, environmental groups, representatives of local government and charitable organisations, and many others.
16	At all of our meetings, we discussed whether the Nordic Region has the ability and the will to take the lead in the transition that the world can and must undergo.
17	We invariably concluded that yes, we have.
18	So what are we waiting for?
