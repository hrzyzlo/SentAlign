0	Arwen is dying.
1	She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.
2	The light of the Evenstar is failing.
3	As Sauron's power grows,
4	her strength wanes.
5	Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.
6	The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.
7	The end has come.
8	It will not be our end, but his.
9	You ride to war,
10	but not to victory.
11	Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know.
12	But in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river.
13	A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south.
14	They'll be in the city in two days.
15	You're outnumbered, Aragorn.
16	You need more men.
17	There are none.
18	There are those who dwell in the mountain.
19	Murderers traitors.
20	You would call upon them to fight?
21	They believe in nothing.
22	They answer to no one.
23	They will answer to the king of Gondor.
24	Andûril, the Flame of the West,
25	forged from the shards of Narsil.
26	Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.
27	The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.
28	The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth.
29	Put aside the Ranger.
30	Become who you were born to be.
31	Take the Dimholt road.
32	I give hope to Men.
33	I keep none for myself.
34	Why are you doing this?
35	The war lies to the east.
36	You cannot leave on the eve of battle.
37	You cannot abandon the men.
38	Éowyn....
39	We need you here.
40	Why have you come?
41	Do you not know?
42	It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.
43	I cannot give you what you seek.
44	I have wished you joy since first I saw you.
45	Just where do you think you're off to?
46	Not this time.
47	This time you must stay, Gimli.
48	Have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves?
49	You might as well accept it.
50	We're going with you, laddie.
51	-What's happening?
52	-Where is he going?
53	Where's he going?
54	I don't understand.
55	Lord Aragorn!
56	Why does he leave on the eve of battle?
57	He leaves because there is no hope.
58	He leaves because he must.
59	Too few have come.
60	We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.
61	No we cannot.
62	But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.
63	I have left instruction.
64	The people are to follow your rule in my stead.
65	Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.
66	Long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.
67	What other duty would you have me do, my lord?
68	Duty?
69	No.
70	I would have you smile again not grieve for those whose time has come.
71	You shall live to see these days renewed and no more despair.
72	What kind of army would linger in such a place?
73	One that is cursed.
74	Long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath to the last king of Gondor to come to his aid to fight.
75	But when the time came when Gondor's need was dire they fled vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.
76	And so Isildur cursed them never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.
77	Who shall call them from the grey twilight?
78	The forgotten people.
79	The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.
80	From the north shall he come.
81	Need shall drive him.
82	He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.
83	The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.
84	The way is shut.
85	It was made by those who are dead.
86	And the Dead keep it.
87	The way is shut.
88	Brego!
89	I do not fear death.
90	Well, this is a thing unheard-of.
91	An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?
92	Oh.
93	Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.
94	We must ride light and swift.
95	It is a long road ahead.
96	And man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight.
97	Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.
98	All my friends have gone to battle.
99	I would be ashamed to be left behind.
100	It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.
101	And none of my riders can bear you as a burden.
102	I want to fight.
103	I will say no more.
104	Ride with me.
105	My lady.
106	Form up!
107	Move out!
108	Form up!
109	Move out!
110	Ride!
111	Ride now to Gondor!
