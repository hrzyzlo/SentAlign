0	- I got Mr Raymond's cigarettes.
1	- Go on in the back.
2	Kid, give me my cigarettes.
3	Wait, wait, wait!
4	Hold it.
5	What's this kid doing here?
6	Get out before I kick your little ass.
7	You ain't kicking shit.
8	Don't worry about him.
9	He runs errands for me.
10	I don't care who he is or what he does.
11	Kids bring me bad luck.
12	The bet is fading.
13	Stop talking and shoot the dice.
14	You're fucking up the game.
15	I ain't shooting shit.
16	I told you kids bring me bad luck.
17	I can't stand them.
18	Now, get the fuck out of here before I kick your ass.
19	You ain't whupping shit.
20	Shoot the dice, you snaggle-toothed motherfucker.
21	All right, I'm going to shoot.
22	But I'd better not crap.
23	That's all I know, I'd better not crap.
24	Come on, 6. I've been waiting all night.
25	Baby needs shoes, new clothes.
26	- And you need some teeth.
27	- Shoot the goddamn dice, man!
28	I'm going to shoot the damn dice.
29	I'll send every one of you home broke.
30	Come on, 6, with your bad ass.
31	Come on!
32	Craps!
33	What are you doing with this kid in here?
34	Didn't I say they're bad luck?
35	What's that sign say?
36	'Ray's Place'.
37	That's me.
38	This is my place.
39	I have in here whoever I want.
40	You lost.
41	So pass the dice, or buy them from this motherfucker.
42	- And I ain't selling.
43	- I ain't buying.
44	I'm going to shoot this again and you're going to get this kid out of here.
45	What the fuck is wrong with you?
46	Man, look, you shot, you lost.
47	We'd have paid you if you won, but you lost.
48	Now, go home and brush that tooth.
49	You think that's funny?
50	I told you I couldn't stand kids in the room.
51	- They're bad luck.
52	You wouldn't listen.
53	- l'm listening.
54	Listen to this.
55	I want back all the money I lost tonight plus what you took in.
56	Do you understand me, you smooth-talking son of a bitch?
57	Tell that old frog-faced dude to go out there and bring back the money.
58	Tell him, or I'll stick your ass, and I'm going to stick him, and I'll stick this little Yankee ass, bad-luck motherfucker standing here.
59	Then you'll have to stick us because I ain't giving you shit.
60	Wait!
61	Before you do, I just want to tell you one thing.
62	Tell me what, punk?
63	What the fuck do you want to tell me?
64	What do you want to tell me?
65	- It slips my mind.
66	- Slips your mind?
67	Holy shit!
68	Goddamn.
69	I guess he does have bad luck with kids.
70	He was going to stab us, so I shot him.
71	Bennie, Slim, Moses, would you help get this dead motherfucker out, please?
72	The game's over for tonight.
73	I'm taking this boy home to his mother.
